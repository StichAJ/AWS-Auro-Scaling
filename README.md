## AWS Auto Scaling Group with Load Balancer-AWS Architecture
# 🚀 Overview
This project presents a foundational AWS architecture that combines an Auto Scaling Group with a Load Balancer. It’s a scalable, highly available design used across cloud-native applications. This implementation ensures applications maintain performance while optimizing costs.
# 🧱 Architecture Components
	• Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) – Distributes incoming web traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
	• EC2 Instances – Virtual machines running the application workload.
	• Auto Scaling Group (ASG) – Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand.
	• Amazon CloudWatch – Monitors performance metrics and triggers scaling policies based on thresholds.
# 🔄 How It Works
	1. Incoming Traffic enters through the ELB.
	2. The ELB distributes the traffic across a pool of EC2 instances managed by the Auto Scaling Group.
	3. CloudWatch Alarms monitor metrics such as CPU utilization.
	4. When thresholds are breached, scaling policies are triggered:
		○ Scale Out: Add more EC2 instances to handle load.
		○ Scale In: Remove instances to reduce cost when demand is low.
# 🌐 Use Case Scenarios
	• Websites and web apps with unpredictable traffic
	• Seasonal or campaign-based traffic spikes
	• Applications that require high availability and performance
# 📌 Key Benefits
	• High Availability: Redundant instances across Availability Zones.
	• Scalability: Dynamically scales up/down based on actual usage.
	• Cost Optimization: You only pay for what you use.
# 🛠️ Technologies Used
	• AWS EC2
	• AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
	• AWS Auto Scaling

# 📈 Next Steps
This is the first in a series of AWS architecture designs. Upcoming designs will include:
	• 3-tier E-Commerce Architecture
	• Serverless Event-driven Architecture
	• Data Engineering Pipelines on AWS
Stay tuned for updates and follow along the series!
